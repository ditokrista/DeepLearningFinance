# PyTorchOptimized.py Error Fix

## Error Description
```
TypeError: ReduceLROnPlateau.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'verbose'
```

## Root Cause
The `verbose` parameter was deprecated and removed in newer versions of PyTorch's `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler. This parameter was used to automatically print learning rate changes during training.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed `verbose` Parameter
**Line 337-339:**
```python
# Before:
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(
    optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.5, patience=10, verbose=True
)

# After:
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(
    optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.5, patience=10
)
```

### 2. Added Manual Learning Rate Logging
**Lines 391-398:**
```python
# Learning rate scheduling
old_lr = optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']
scheduler.step(val_loss)
new_lr = optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']

# Log learning rate changes
if new_lr != old_lr:
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Reducing learning rate from {old_lr:.6f} to {new_lr:.6f}")
    current_lr = new_lr
```

This manual logging provides the same functionality as the deprecated `verbose=True` parameter.

## Benefits of the Fix
1. ✅ Compatible with all PyTorch versions (both old and new)
2. ✅ Maintains the same logging functionality
3. ✅ More explicit control over learning rate change notifications
4. ✅ Clearer output messages

## Testing
The model should now train without errors. You'll see learning rate reduction messages like:
```
Epoch 45: Reducing learning rate from 0.001000 to 0.000500
```

## Additional Notes
- The scheduler reduces learning rate by factor 0.5 when validation loss doesn't improve for 10 epochs
- This helps the model fine-tune and converge better
- The current learning rate is always displayed in the epoch progress logs
