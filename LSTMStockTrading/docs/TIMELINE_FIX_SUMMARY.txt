TIMELINE CONTINUITY FIX - SUMMARY
================================================================================

ISSUE REPORTED:
"Disjunctioned data among training, validation, and test sets. 
Plot returns jumpy curves instead of smooth timeline."

ROOT CAUSE:
Sequences were created SEPARATELY for each split (train/val/test), causing each
split to start from index 0. This broke temporal continuity.

================================================================================
THE FIX (Lines 172-208 in PyTorchOptimized.py)
================================================================================

BEFORE (WRONG - Caused Jumps):
-------------------------------
1. Split data: train_data, val_data, test_data
2. Scale each: train_scaled, val_scaled, test_scaled  
3. Create sequences FROM EACH SPLIT:
   - X_train from train_scaled (indices 0 to N_train)
   - X_val from val_scaled (indices 0 to N_val)     ← Starts over!
   - X_test from test_scaled (indices 0 to N_test)  ← Starts over!

Result: Three disconnected segments in plot


AFTER (CORRECT - Smooth Timeline):
-----------------------------------
1. Fit scaler on training data ONLY (prevent leakage)
2. Transform ENTIRE dataset with training scaler stats
3. Create sequences FROM ENTIRE DATASET:
   - X_all from all scaled data (indices 0 to N_total)
4. Split the sequences:
   - X_train = X_all[0:train_size]
   - X_val = X_all[train_size:train_size+val_size]
   - X_test = X_all[train_size+val_size:]

Result: Smooth, continuous timeline

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHT
================================================================================

Scaling transformation ≠ Data leakage

SAFE:
- Fit scaler on training data
- Transform entire dataset with those stats
- This is exactly what we do in production!

DATA LEAKAGE:
- Would be if scaler.fit() saw validation/test data
- Our scaler ONLY learns from training data ✓

TEMPORAL CONTINUITY:
- Sequences must span actual timeline
- Create from entire dataset, then split
- Maintains date alignment ✓

================================================================================
CODE CHANGES
================================================================================

Changed From:
-------------
train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(train_data)
val_scaled = scaler.transform(val_data)
test_scaled = scaler.transform(test_data)

X_train, y_train = create_sequences(train_scaled, look_back)
X_val, y_val = create_sequences(val_scaled, look_back)    # ← Breaks continuity
X_test, y_test = create_sequences(test_scaled, look_back)  # ← Breaks continuity


Changed To:
-----------
scaler.fit(train_data)                      # Learn from train only
values_scaled = scaler.transform(values)    # Transform entire dataset

X_all, y_all = create_sequences(values_scaled, look_back)  # Continuous!

X_train = X_all[:train_seq_size]
X_val = X_all[train_seq_size:train_seq_size + val_seq_size]
X_test = X_all[train_seq_size + val_seq_size:]

================================================================================
EXPECTED RESULT
================================================================================

Before Fix:
-----------
Plot appearance: 
[Train segment] --- JUMP --- [Val segment] --- JUMP --- [Test segment]

After Fix:
----------
Plot appearance:
[Train segment] → [Val segment] → [Test segment]  (Smooth transition!)

The timeline now flows naturally from training through validation to test,
with no discontinuities or jumps.

================================================================================
VERIFICATION
================================================================================

When you run: python PyTorchOptimized.py

You should see:
✓ Smooth, continuous price curves
✓ Natural transitions between train/val/test
✓ No jumps or disconnections
✓ Dates align properly across all sets

The plot should look like a continuous stock price chart with different
colored sections, NOT three separate disconnected pieces.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

Timeline Example (100 days total):
-----------------------------------
Days 1-70:   Training (70 days)
Days 71-85:  Validation (15 days)
Days 86-100: Test (15 days)

OLD APPROACH (Broken):
Train sequences:  [1-60→61], [2-61→62], ..., [10-69→70]
Val sequences:    [1-60→61], [2-61→62], ..., [WRONG!]
Test sequences:   [1-60→61], [2-61→62], ..., [WRONG!]

NEW APPROACH (Fixed):
All sequences:    [1-60→61], [2-61→62], ..., [40-99→100]
                           ↓
Split sequences:
Train:   [1-60→61], ..., [10-69→70]
Val:     [11-70→71], ..., [25-84→85]    ← Continuous!
Test:    [26-85→86], ..., [40-99→100]   ← Continuous!
