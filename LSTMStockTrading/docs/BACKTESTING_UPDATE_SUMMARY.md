# Backtesting.py Update Summary

## Date: 2025-10-12

## Changes Made

Successfully updated `Backtesting.py` to support **12 features** instead of just 1 feature (close price only), matching the architecture in `PyTorchOptimized.py`.

---

## Key Modifications

### 1. Added Technical Indicators Function
**Location:** Lines 16-42

Added `calculate_technical_indicators(df)` function that computes 12 price-based features:
- `close` - Close price (target variable)
- `returns` - Price returns
- `sma_5` - 5-day simple moving average
- `sma_20` - 20-day simple moving average
- `rsi` - Relative Strength Index
- `macd` - MACD indicator
- `macd_signal` - MACD signal line
- `bb_position` - Bollinger Band position
- `bb_width` - Bollinger Band width
- `momentum` - Price momentum
- `volatility` - Rolling volatility
- `roc` - Rate of change

### 2. Added ImprovedLSTM Class
**Location:** Lines 46-76

Added `ImprovedLSTM` class that matches the architecture in `PyTorchOptimized.py`:
- Input dimension: 12 features
- Hidden dimension: 256
- Number of layers: 3
- Dropout: 0.3
- Includes layer normalization, batch normalization, and residual connections

### 3. Updated generate_trading_signals Method
**Location:** Lines 129-204

Modified to:
- Calculate technical indicators from historical data
- Use all 12 features for sequence generation
- Properly handle multi-dimensional input (sequence_length, num_features)
- Correctly inverse transform predictions using dummy arrays
- Changed default sequence_length from 59 to 60 (matching PyTorchOptimized.py)

### 4. Updated Model Loading Section
**Location:** Lines 677-698

Changed from:
```python
model = torch.load(model_path, weights_only=False)
```

To:
```python
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

model = ImprovedLSTM(
    input_dim=12,  # 12 features
    hidden_dim=256,
    num_layers=3,
    dropout=0.3,
    output_dim=1
).to(device)

model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path, map_location=device, weights_only=True))
model.eval()
```

## File Backup

A backup of the original file was created at:
`Backtesting.py.backup`

---

## Compatibility

The updated `Backtesting.py` now requires:
1. Model trained with `PyTorchOptimized.py` (12 features)
2. Scaler fitted on 12 features (saved as `{stock}_scaler_optimized.pkl`)
3. Model weights saved as `{stock}_optimized_model.pth`

---

## Testing

To test the updated backtesting system:

```python
python Backtesting.py
```

The script will:
1. Load the ImprovedLSTM model with 12 input features
2. Calculate technical indicators from price data
3. Generate trading signals using all 12 features
4. Run backtest and create visualizations
5. Save performance summary

---

## Notes

- The old `LSTM` class is still present in the file for backward compatibility
- The `ImprovedLSTM` class is now used by default in the main execution
- All feature calculations match exactly with `PyTorchOptimized.py`
- Sequence length is now 60 (matching the training configuration)

---

## Automation Script

The update was performed using `update_backtesting.py`, which can be reused if needed to revert or re-apply changes.
